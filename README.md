# AutoLedger
Point of sales system consisting of an automated ledger, cash register, and inventory management for a small student ran coffee business
Note, before you run the program, you need to set up the database in order to run it properly.
 The first thing you need to do is to make sure you have a database in mysql with
 localhost:3306, user: root, and password: 1234, otherwise some modification needs to be made
 to the code.
 The next thing you need to do is open the file titled pos as a model in mysql workbench as it is a
 .mwb file. Then once you have opened it, forward engineer it to port 3306, hostname: localhost,
 and set username to root. Once the database has been set up, it will run fine.
 Finally, the name of the database schema has to be “pos” in order to function properly. That is
 all, thank you
